## Leaflet Mapping 

This is a ui.R and server.R for the shiny application hosted at https://rich.shinyapps.io/mapping/.  

This application takes in a .csv file with at least one column called zip. The user can add additional columns if desired.  

The observations are then geocoded at the zipcode level and are map.  As the user zooms and pans the maps the data displayed in the table is filtered to include only the observations visible on the map. 

I thought others may find this functionality useful and may come up with suggestions for expanding on this functionality.
